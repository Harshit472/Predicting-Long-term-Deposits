# Predicting-Long-term-Deposits
In a highly competitive banking environment, effectively targeting potential customers for
long-term deposits is crucial. The bank's marketing department conducts phone call campaigns to sell
long-term deposit products. However, these campaigns can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.
To optimize the process, it is essential to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a long-term
deposit based on previous marketing call data and customer information.
